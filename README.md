# GOFAI

Implementation of some early GOFAI/Knowledge Engineering algorithms

`noughtsCrosses.ml` is an implements game tree generating and searching using poly/ML.

`noughtsCrosses.py` contains rules for the next player, winning conditions and what the next move should be.

`minimax.py` contains the function `decision(playerID, initialBoard)` which, when executed, returns a new board with playerID's best move computed using the minimax procedure. This requires a module of rules for two player games (initialBoard, move, moveAll, evaluate), such as the ones found in `noughtsCrosses.py`.

`sudoku.pl` is a constraint propagation sudoku solver using prolog. This file is generated by `sudoku.py`. After importing the program into a `swipl` editor, solutions can be generated by the following, but with some tile values changed to {1 ... 9}. The tile numbering scheme starts with 0 at the top left corner, which is incremented rightwards.

`sudoku([H0, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H11, H12, H13, H14, H15, H16, H17, H18, H19, H20, H21, H22, H23, H24, H25, H26, H27, H28, H29, H30, H31, H32, H33, H34, H35, H36, H37, H38, H39, H40, H41, H42, H43, H44, H45, H46, H47, H48, H49, H50, H51, H52, H53, H54, H55, H56, H57, H58, H59, H60, H61, H62, H63, H64, H65, H66, H67, H68, H69, H70, H71, H72, H73, H74, H75, H76, H77, H78, H79, H80]).`
